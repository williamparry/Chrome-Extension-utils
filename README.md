chrome-extension-utils
======================

Small library of utilities for Chrome Extension developers.

Chrome uses Javascript 1.8, which, coupled with CSS3 means you probably don't have to use jQuery in your apps.

To use
------

Grab the utils-1.3.js file and include it in your extensions.

If you want to run the tests, load up the folder unpacked into your chrome extensions.

If you want intellisense, include the utils-1.3-vsdoc.js file (the chrome vs-doc one isn't complete)

Features

- Port Messenger
- Request Messenger
- localStorage Data Access Layer
- Object helpers
- DOM helpers
- Array helper
- Tab capture full
- XHR Manager (new in 1.1)
